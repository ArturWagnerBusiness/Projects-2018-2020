# Repository of projects form 2018-2020
This repository is a copy of an original one due to leaks in personal data in few commits.<br>

These projects were everything which I did on my own for myself, either in school or at home. Many projects are small random applications that I just came to create because the idea sounded cool.


#### Notable directories:

+ `/Python_Projects/` - Python projects.
